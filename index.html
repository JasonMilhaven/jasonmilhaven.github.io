				<p id="short">Junior Year - Computer Science</p>
				<p id="desc">At the University of Massachusetts, I’ve been able to immerse myself in the study of Computer Science.  My notable completed courses include the following:<br><br>
				
				<span style="font-weight: 700;">Computing II (informally "Data Structures")</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">implementation and applications of data structures</span><br><br>
				<!--
				When first learning to write code, I had taken for granted the basic list structures we use to store and access data - especially those of higher level languages.  I was fascinated to
				-->
				
				<span style="font-weight: 700;">Computer Systems Principles</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">low level C programming, UNIX system fundamentals, threading, and network programming</span><br><br>
				
				<span style="font-weight: 700;">Programming Methodology</span><br><span style="font-style: italic;">functional programming, design patterns, testing and debugging</span><br><br>
				
				At UMass, I am surrounded by a wealth of supportive and academically inclined peers. I look forward to continuing my journey to achieve my Computer Science degree.</p>

				<p><a id="title" href="https://www.firstinspires.org/robotics/frc" target="_blank">FIRST Robotics</a></p>
				<p id="short">2016 - 2018</p>
				<p id="desc">As a member of the FIRST Robotics team at Assabet, I worked alongside students from other local schools as well as many professional programmers who volunteered their time to our team.  We would coordinate with other members of our team to construct a robot to compete in tournaments.  During my time at FIRST, I was tasked with ensuring our robot had the ability to move, climb, and shoot in order to score "points" as determined by the goal of the competition.<br><br>
				
				We participated in several competitions against other similar groups in Massachusetts.  It was an iterative process - after every competition, we would address our robot's flaws and return with new goals and a renewed focus.<br><br>
				
				I will admit that my dad pushed me to join the group - <span style="font-style: italic;">”It will look good on your college applications”</span> - but I am thankful for the knowledge I have been able to take away from my time in FIRST.  Our adult mentors allowed us a great deal of agency, remaining supportive without being overbearing.<br><br>
				
				This experience opened me up to the practicalities of software development, as I collaborated with others to create a product.  I gained experience in collaboration with source control with members of the team.  I used the Java programming language, the provided FRC libraries for our robot, and learned various design patterns on the way (Object-Oriented, Command, State Machine).</p>

				<p id="short">Class of 2018</p>
				<p id="desc">As a vocational-technical school, Assabet allowed students to pursue a vocation of their choice every other week.  The Computer Programming and Web Development vocation offered me the opportunity to learn practical skills in web design, computer programming, and troubleshooting computers.  In my three years here, my love of computers grew, and my understanding of the potential of technology expanded immensely.<br><br>Before I attended Assabet, I knew that I wanted to further my education in computers and technology, with the intent of working in the tech industry.  This high school set me up for success, and further cemented my interest in computers.<br><br>I am grateful for my three years at Assabet Valley Tech.
