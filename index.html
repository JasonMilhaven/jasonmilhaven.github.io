				<p id="desc">I have to say a lot of people have been asking this question. No, really. A lot of people come up to me and they ask me. They say, "What's 2+2"? And I tell them look, we know what 2+2 is. We've had almost eight years of the worst kind of math you can imagine. Oh my god, I can't believe it. Addition and subtraction of the 1s the 2s and the 3s. Its terrible. Its just terrible. Look, if you want to know what 2+2 is, do you want to know what 2+2 is? I'll tell you. First of all the number 2, by the way I love the number 2. It's probably my favorite number, no it is my favorite number. You know what, it's probably more like the number two but with a lot of zeros behind it. A lot. If I'm being honest, I mean, if I'm being honest. I like a lot of zeros. Except for Marco Rubio, now he's a zero that I don't like. Though, I probably shouldn't say that. He's a nice guy but he's like, "10101000101", on and on, like that. He's like a computer! You know what I mean? He's like a computer. I don't know. I mean, you know. So, we have all these numbers and we can add them and subtract them and add them. TIMES them even. Did you know that? We can times them OR divide them, they don't tell you that, and I'll tell you, no one is better at the order of operations than me. You wouldn't believe it. That I can tell you. So, we're gonna be the best on 2+2, believe me. OK? Alright.</p>

				<p id="short">2016 - 2017</p>
				<p id="desc">As a student programmer, I worked alongside students from other local schools as well as adults.  We would coordinate with other members of our team to construct a robot to compete in tournaments.  In this project, I used the Java programming language, the FRC libraries, and learned various design patterns on the way (Command, State Machine).  I gained experience in collaboration in source control with members of the team.</p>

				<p id="desc">The Computer Programming and Web Design vocation offered me the opportunity to learn practical skills in web design, computer programming, and troubleshooting computers.  I furthered my love of computers and knew I wanted to further my education in computers and technology, with the intent of working in the tech industry.<br><br>I am grateful for these three years at Assabet Valley Tech.
